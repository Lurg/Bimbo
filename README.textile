Bimbo is an equipment optimizer based off "be.imba.hu":http://be.imba.hu/.
Bimbo will scan your equipped items looking for missed enchants and gems.
Unlike be.imba, Bimbo won't critique your choice of enchants, gems, stats or talents.
It will not "grade" or "rate" your gear in any way, it simply looks for enchants you've overlooked.
